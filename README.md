# 🚀 100 Days of Django

> 🔥 A personal challenge to master Django in 100 Days — from zero to deployment, one commit at a time.

## 🎯 Why I'm Doing This

I’m on a mission to become an unstoppable **Full-Stack Developer**. Django isn't just a framework — it’s a gateway to building real-world, scalable applications. This challenge is my way of staying consistent, pushing boundaries, and sharing my journey publicly.
